# What is EmotiMate?

EmotiMate is an Android-based mental health application designed to help individuals monitor their emotional states and receive AI-powered therapeutic support when needed. Addressing common modern-day mental health issues such as depression and anxiety, our goal was to create a more accessible and awareness-oriented support tool for emotional well-being.

## Key Features

- Daily mood tracking and emotional journaling  
- Schema-based psychological tests and personalized feedback  
- AI-powered mental health engine based on **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash**, offering:
  - Emotion analysis  
  - Interpretation of psychological test results (Beck, PANAS, POMS, etc.)  
  - Schema therapy-based recommendations  
  - Empathic responses  
- Cognitive reframing tool  
- Breathing exercises and mindfulness suggestions  
- Meditation and relaxation sound library  
- Psychologist profiles and user feedback system  
- A dynamic suggestion mechanism that analyzes emotional trends and offers CBT-based guidance in appropriate situations  
- Personalized psychological assessment reports generated by the AI system, based on historical data, for users who decide to consult a professional psychologist  

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Android development with Kotlin (Jetpack – ViewModel, LiveData, Navigation Component)  
- **Backend:** Python & FastAPI + Uvicorn for RESTful API services  
- **Data Management:** Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Realtime Database  
- **AI Integration:** EmotiMateAgent (emotion analysis, test interpretation, recommendation engine)  
- **UI/UX:** Interface design planned and developed through Figma  

## Project Goal

According to the World Health Organization, nearly **1 billion people** suffer from mental health issues each year, yet access to professional support remains limited.  

Our aim was to develop a personalized digital assistant that addresses this challenge by offering emotional support tailored to the individual's needs. EmotiMate integrates psychological theory with technology to help users gain awareness about their own mental health and build sustainable emotional well-being.
